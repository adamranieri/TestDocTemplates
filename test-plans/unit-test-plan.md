# Test Plan for Caitlin's Couples Counseling Utility Functions

### Level of testing
Unit

### Test Objectives
- All utility functions are tested with positive and negative tests

- Code is written to code compliance standards
  - Naming conventions
  - Spelling
  - whitespace consistency

### Test Approach/Strategy
- Caitlin's Couples Conseling utility functions package

### Test Object(s)
- Repositroy located at [source](notreal)

### In Scope
- Functional
  - All functions located in the utilities package
- Non-functional

- Static
  - A code quality and readability report 
  - 
### Out of scope
- All code located outside of the utilities package
- Functions in the utilties package that are comprised of multiple functions that have been tested

### Entry Criteria
- Source code located at [source](notreal)
- **Test Environment**
  - Tests will be written using JUnit 5
  - Tests will be added to the src/test/dev/ccc/utilties package
  - The execution of tests will be done on the testers local machine for functional tests
    - For non functional tests the tests should be executed on the CI pipeline
